        <b>Monday, June 3, 2019</b>
        <p>I just finished reading <i>Bad Blood</i>. It's been while since I dedicated real time to reading. It's hard not to get swept up in responsibilities and life. It's almost like taking time to immerse myself in another world is a luxury I can no longer afford. So, it's helpful when a book is so captivating, I can't put it down. The fact it's based on real events with real testimonies just makes the story that much more delicious.</p>
        <p>One thing I can't shake is the evidence of how truly unfair the world is. There are so many instances of people trying to do the right thing and suffering at the hands of the powerful and wealthy. Please, please, please read! It is worth the time and emotional toil.</p>
        <p>Side note. Incredibly entertaining to read continuous references to Elizabeth Holmes' voice and then to hear it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9eBFKXkKk4'>Theranos Commercial</a></p>
